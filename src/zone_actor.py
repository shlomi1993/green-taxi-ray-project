"""
Ray actor implementation for per-zone state management.

ZoneActor owns mutable replay state and accepted decisions for a single zone.
Supports both blocking and async modes:
- In blocking mode, the driver writes decisions directly.
- In async mode, scoring tasks report to the actor and the driver finalizes ticks with partial-readiness policy.

Key features:
- Idempotent writes keyed by (zone_id, tick_id)
- Fallback policy for incomplete ticks (always_previous)
- Observability counters for late/duplicate reports and fallback usage
